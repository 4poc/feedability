h1. Feedability

"Feedability":https://github.com/4poc/feedability/ is a proxy server for atom and rss feeds that tries to make them more usable by including the full content of each article. It uses "arc90labs":http://lab.arc90.com/ original "readability":http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/, a client bookmarklet written in javascript, for main content extraction/information extraction. Feedability is using the networking framework "node.js":http://nodejs.org/, it furthermore depends on the "readability node.js library":https://github.com/arrix/node-readability by "arrix":https://github.com/arrix, "node bindings":https://github.com/astro/node-expat for the fast "xml parser expat":http://expat.sourceforge.net/ by "Astro":https://github.com/astro, "node bindings":https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv for the charset recoding library "iconv":http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ by "bnoordhuis":https://github.com/bnoordhuis, the "node compression":https://github.com/sjmulder/node-compress library by "waveto":https://github.com/waveto/node-compress, "egorich239":https://github.com/egorich239/ and "sjmulder":https://github.com/sjmulder, "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ developed by "The jQuery Project Team":http://jquery.org/team and "node-sqlite":https://github.com/orlandov/node-sqlite by "grumdrig":https://github.com/grumdrig and "orlandov":https://github.com/orlandov.

h2. Installation

I will try to create a first release candidate soon, until now you need to use the master branch. Make sure you've installed a recent version of node ("wiki":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/) and npm ("README":https://github.com/isaacs/npm#readme).

* Clone the repository, you can skip the submodule init if you installed the "(correct) compress module":https://github.com/sjmulder/node-compress manually:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/4poc/feedability.git
cd feedability/
git submodule update --init
cd node_modules/compress; sh build.sh; cd ../../
</pre>

* Install the required libraries: (node-sqlite is optional, only necessary if you want to import firefox cookies)

<pre>
npm install readability node-expat iconv node-sqlite
# OR globally:
sudo npm install -g readability node-expat iconv node-sqlite
</pre>

* To start the server: @node feedability.js@ ...
* but I recommend to demonize it, using forever (@sudo npm install -g forever@) or similar: @forever start -l forever.log -o forever_stdout.log -e forever_stderr.log feedability.js@
* For more documentation visit the "wiki":https://github.com/4poc/feedability/wiki
