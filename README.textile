h1. Feedability

"Feedability":https://github.com/4poc/feedability/ is a proxy server for atom and rss feeds that tries to make them more usable by including the full content of each article. It uses "arc90labs":http://lab.arc90.com/ original "readability":http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/, a client bookmarklet written in javascript, for main content extraction/information extraction. Feedability is written in "JavaScript":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript using "googles v8 engine":http://code.google.com/p/v8/ and the networking framework "node.js":http://nodejs.org/, it furthermore depends on the "readability node.js library":https://github.com/arrix/node-readability written by "arrix":https://github.com/arrix, "node bindings":https://github.com/astro/node-expat for the fast "xml parser expat":http://expat.sourceforge.net/ written by "Astro":https://github.com/astro, "node bindings":https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv for the charset recoding library "iconv":http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ written by "bnoordhuis":https://github.com/bnoordhuis, the "node compression":https://github.com/egorich239/node-compress library written by "egorich239":https://github.com/egorich239/ and the javascript library "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ developed by "The jQuery Project Team":http://jquery.org/team.

h2. Installation

Feedability is under heavy development, there is no release at the moment,
but you can try the current development repository. You should expect
problems, please report them back!

* Install node.js using your distribution package manager or compile it from source. For detailed installation instructions consider the "node wiki":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/: "Installation":https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Installation.
* Install "npm":http://npmjs.org/, the de-facto standard package manager for node: "README":https://github.com/isaacs/npm#readme with setup instructions.
* **or** if you using arch linux you can use the AUR packages "nodejs":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=32930 and "nodejs-npm":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=43626.
* Run @node -v@ and @npm -v@ to make sure everything works, then, install the necessary depended libraries:

<pre>
$ npm install readability
$ npm install node-expat
$ npm install iconv
</pre>

* Currently the stable version of "node-compress":https://github.com/egorich239/node-compress is not availible as a npm package, you need to install the "v0-3-3-support":https://github.com/BrightTag/node-compress/tree/v0-3-3-support branch from BrightTag manually:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/BrightTag/node-compress.git
$ cd node-compress
$ git checkout origin/v0-3-3-support
$ npm install
</pre>

* To make sure node finds all depended libraries you can run:

<pre>
$ node
> require('readability'); require('compress'); require('iconv'); require('node-expat');
</pre>

If something is wrong you should see an error message like @"Error: Cannot find module '[missing library]'"@.

* Clone and run the feedability development repository:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/4poc/feedability.git
$ cd feedability
$ node feedability.js
