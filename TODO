Readability/Filters

- readability returns: "Sorry, unable to parse article content. Please view 
  the original page instead." if it was unable to parse it. Should detect
  that and restore the original excerpt. (maybe keep the excerpt anyways)
- manage to use the readability dom tree for filtering
- support for filtering of main content pre-selection: extract the element
  using jquery selector

Proxy

- detect images (and maybe other content) and download it locally so that the
  proxy can serve it from cache.
- caching proxy that runs readability for text/html

Cache

- gzip the cache files (make generic api for that)

Feed Parser

- rewrite the feed parser/generator using a xml dom library (jsdom?)

Crawler

- fetch and respect the robots.txt file

Refactoring

- seperate feedability.js's execution of readability
- use a library for flow control
- testcases!
