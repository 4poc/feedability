Refactoring

- use a library for flow control
- testcases!

Readability/Filters

- readability returns: "Sorry, unable to parse article content. Please view 
  the original page instead." if it was unable to parse it. Should detect
  that and restore the original excerpt. (maybe keep the excerpt anyways)
- manage to use the readability dom tree for filtering

Proxy

- detect images (and maybe other content) and download it locally so that the
  proxy can serve it from cache.
- caching proxy that runs readability for text/html

Cache

- gzip the cache files (make generic api for that)

Crawler

- fetch and respect the robots.txt file
