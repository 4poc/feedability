I've ordered the list after the importance.

- readability returns: "Sorry, unable to parse article content. Please view 
  the original page instead." if it was unable to parse it. Should detect
  that and restore the original excerpt.
- reuse the excerpt found in the feed, for instance to improve the readability
  detection or just include it in the feed somehow. (currently its thrown away)
- detect images (and maybe other content) and download it locally so that the
  proxy can serve it from cache. *or* make sure the image links are pointing
  to an absolute url.
- make cache files a little bit more accessible: use directories for domains
  and timestamps etc. for the filename? How about creating a special 
  directory with more usable information as directories and softlinks?
- gzip the cache files
- currently I built a jsdom tree for the jquery selector filtering, but this
  does not really make sense because readability is creating a jsdom tree
  anyways, it would be cool to have pre and post hooks to manipulate the
  dom tree that readability is using.
- ...
- fetch and respect the robots.txt file of the sites
- rewrite the feed parser/generator using jsdom etc. I do not like the way
  the current implementation is building the feed xml with the &replace..
- refactor the utils2 (or maybe use another library for this anyway)
- ...
- sort this list
